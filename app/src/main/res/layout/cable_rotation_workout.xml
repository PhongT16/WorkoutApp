                android:text="External: 1.	Adjust the cable to the same height as your elbow. Stand with your left side to the band a couple of feet away. 2.	Grasp the handle with your right hand, and keep your elbow pressed firmly to your side. We recommend you hold a pad or foam roll in place with your elbow to keep it firmly in position. 3.	With your upper arm in position, your elbow should be flexed to 90 degrees with your hand reaching across the front of your torso. This will be your starting position. 4.	Execute the movement by rotating your arm in a backhand motion, keeping your elbow in place. Continue as far as you are able, pause, and then return to the starting position. Internal: 1.	Sit next to a low pulley sideways (with legs stretched in front of you or crossed) and grasp the single hand cable attachment with the arm nearest to the cable. Tip: If you can adjust the pulley’s height, you can use a flat bench to sit on instead. 2.	Position the elbow against your side with the elbow bent at 90Â° and the arm pointing towards the pulley. This will be your starting position. 3.	Pull the single hand cable attachment toward your body by internally rotating your shoulder until your forearm is across your abs. You will be creating an imaginary semi-circle. Tip: The forearm should be perpendicular to your torso at all times. 4.	Slowly go back to the initial position. " />
